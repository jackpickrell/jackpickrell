## Hi there, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance developer based in Devon, working with modern technologies to create exciting web and mobile applications. 

I primarily work with [Kozo Creative](https://kozocreative.com), a digital agency specialising in building helpful applications and ecommerce websites for small and medium businesses across the UK. I'm also open to short-term or part-time contract projects as a solo full-stack developer.
